#### What data is recovered by Ponicode ?

Ponicode will **not** save your code or your tests at any time when calling the `ponicode test` or `ponicode run` commands. We only extract the metrics that will be used for the calculation of the dashboard indicators.

<!--
- Number of generated unit tests
- Number of generated unit edge cases
- Number of function tested by Ponicode
- Coverage
- Name (and file path) of some untested functions
- File path of tested functions -->
