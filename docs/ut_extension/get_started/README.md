# Get Started 

In this section you will find all the basic information you need to get started.

First of all, learn how to [install and activate](ut_extension/get_started/installation.md) the Ponicode extension, and how to [enable it or disable it](ut_extension/get_started/startStopPonicode.md) as you need.

Then skip through to learn how to create your first AI-powered unit test, both with our one-click [Flash test](../flash_test/README.md) solution, and [using the Ponicode Interface](../gui_test/firstUtGUI.md).
