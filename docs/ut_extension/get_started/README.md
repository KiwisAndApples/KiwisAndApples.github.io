## Get Started with the Ponicode Unit Test extension

In this section you will find all the basic information you need to get started.

First of all, learn how to [install and activate](ut_extension/get_started/installation.md) the Ponicode extension, and how to [enable it or disable it](ut_extension/get_started/first_steps/startStopPonicode.md) as you need.

Then skip through to learn how to create your first AI-powered unit test, both with our one-click [Flash test](ut_extension/get_started/first_steps/firstFlashTest.md) solution, and [using the Ponicode Interface](ut_extension/get_started/first_steps/firstUtGUI.md).
